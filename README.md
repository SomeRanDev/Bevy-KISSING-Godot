# Bevy💋Godot
Use Bevy in Godot by forcing them to smooch a whole bunch.

This is a personal project I'm creating from scratch so I understand the inner workings of Godot/Bevy interactions. Use [godot-bevy](https://github.com/bytemeadow/godot-bevy) if you want something with better documentation (I will do it eventually).
